cwd has to be the repo

###Running Directions   
Your file path has to be like C:/Users/stuff/game-jam-2020 for this game to work  
So yea you're gonna have to run: "python gamer_gang/triple_blocks.py"  
Maybe requirements.txt too

###Game Mechanics   
Up, Left, Right arrows OR WAD keys to move (space to pause the game)  
1, 2, 3 to control the green, red, and purple squares/cubes whatever you wanna call 'em   
Down arrow or S key to split the stack that you're currently in  
Get on top of another cube to join with them  
Collect all the stars to unlock the exit door  
You have to get all three squares/cubes to the exit door at the end of the level to complete it  
Spikes and bees hate you tho
