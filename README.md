cwd has to be the repo
how do you put images in a readme; if someone knows, plz open a pull and put some screenies in

#Running Directions   
Your file path has to be like C:/Users/stuff/deathpacito for this game to work  
So yea you're gonna have to run: "python triple_blocks.py"  
Maybe requirements.txt too

#Game Mechanics   
Up, Left, Right arrows OR WAD keys to move (space to pause the game)  
1, 2, 3 to control the green, red, and purple squares/cubes whatever you wanna call 'em   
Down arrow or S key to split the stack that you're currently in  
Get on top of another cube to join with them  
Collect all the stars to unlock the exit door  
You have to get all three squares/cubes to the exit door at the end of the level to complete it  
Spikes and bees hate you tho

had some friends help me out with some bugs in the physics engine
